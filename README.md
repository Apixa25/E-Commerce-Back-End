## Description 

[See the functionality in action using Insomnia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a2raZDEp0QU8CRyeofVFlahRXffGLhXb/view) ðŸ‘€

E-commerce in 2021 was estimated to have generated $2.54 Trillion in business in the United States.  This is such a massive number that it makes it obvious that having a robust, and secure server-side (back end) application to store and send data for this type of business is not only needed but also imperative. 

The code that I have worked on here is the back end of a potential e-commerce site.  It uses an Express.js API configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It also uses dotenv to use environmental variables to store sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and database names.
